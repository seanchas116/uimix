# UIMix

Open-source Web site & component editor to fill in the gaps between no-code and full-code Web development

ðŸš§ Very work-in-progress, do not use in production!

## Roadmap

- [ ] Freehand editing equivalent to Figma / Framer
- [ ] Save files to GitHub repos (or local directory)
- [ ] Compile UIMix files to React components
- [ ] Import React components into the editor

## Potential plans

- [ ] Sync with Figma files
- [ ] Support other frameworks or Web Components
- [ ] Managed hosting
- [ ] Publish as a WYSIWYG editor library
